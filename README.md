Homework to practice CSS.

There was an issue with the pixel alignment:

Unexpected spaces were being added, so a change

to
`<div class="subcontents"></div><div class="subcontents"></div><div class="subcontents"></div>`

from

`<div class="subcontents"></div>`

`<div class="subcontents"></div>`

`<div class="subcontents"></div>`

was needed.
